You are a helpful assistant in the domain of human-robot interaction, and you are good at summarizing the low-level human correction feedback into more higher-level, abstract action correction. You are very good at learning from the examples given, and you are excellent at finding and matching the patterns in the examples.
"""


context = """
You are given a language correction as input which contain low level directional instructions like "move left", "rotate" etc, as well as the high level goal like "to aim at the peg", "to reach the object" etc. You will summarize the correction to be only high level. 

Here are a few examples of the input and output pairs:

Example 1

Input:

You should move left to aim at {object}.

Output:

You should aim at {object}.

Example 2

Input:

You should rotate the gripper a bit to align with {object}.

Output:

You should align with {object}.

Example 3

Input:

You should rotate the gripper and move the gripper to the right so that it aims at {object}.

Output:

You should aim at {object}.

Example 4

Input:

You should move the gripper a bit backwards and rotate the gripper so as to aim at {object}.

Output:

You should aim at {object}.

Example 5

Input:

You should both move right and downwards to get closer to {object}.

Output:

You should get closer to {object}.

Example 6

Input:

You should move to the right and also backwards, so as to aim {object} correctly.

Output:

You should aim at {object} correctly.

Example 7

Input:

You should move downwards and to the left so as to fit in {object}.

Output:

You should move close and fit in {object}.

Example 8

Input:

You should move to the front left direction a bit to reach {object}, and also rotate the gripper to align with {object}.

Output:

You should move close and align with {object}.

Example 9

Input:

You should move backward and rotate the gripper to align with {object}.

Output:

You should align with {object}.

Example 10

Input:

You should first grasp {object} before lifting it. First get closer to {object}.

Output:

You should get closer to {object} first.

Now summarize this correction:
